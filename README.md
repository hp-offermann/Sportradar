## Thoughts on the development 

I have never made a calendar before, so this project was a first for me. I started by making a static 
calendar because I thought it would be easier, considering that I only should display the month of november.
During the development was I realising that it was only more difficult and wasn't practical, so I decided to take the dynamic approach.
