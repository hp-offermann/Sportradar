A calendar interface for sport events

TO-DO:
- [ ] Create a calendar interface for the current month.
- [ ] Display the days of the month in a grid format.
- [ ] Indicate days that have scheduled sports events. This can be as simple as a dot or marker on the day. --> from JSON file
- [ ] Implement functionality so that when a user clicks on an event marker on the calendar, they are taken to a detail page. The detail page should display all relevant information about the event, such as date,
  time, sport, teams/participants, and any other details you consider important.
- [ ] Create a form where users can input details for a new event (e.g., date, time, sport,
  teams/participants).
- [ ] Ensure the site is fully responsive on mobile and tablet device
- [ ] Implement a navigation bar or menu that allows users to switch between the calendar overview and the "Add Event" page. Ensure the navigation is accessible from all pages.

Optional: 
- [ ] Show brief information about the events on the calendar (e.g., event name on the day cell).
- [ ] Implement filters to allow users to view events based on specific criteria (e.g., by sport, date range)
- [ ] Store events using local storage or any other method to retain data between sessions
- [ ] Write tests to verify that your code works as expected.
